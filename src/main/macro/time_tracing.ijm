# Time tracing

This macro shows how to trace the duration of image processing workflows. 
When doing so, we can trace the taken time for underlying operations, such
as for the top-hat filter.

When executing this script, run it twice! 
You may observe that the second execution is faster, because of the 
[warm-up effect](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36198278/why-does-the-jvm-require-warmup).

## Stop and inspect the time tracing
After the workflow finished, we can have a look on all underlying operations and its execution time,
for each single step and as total duration:

Clean up at the end.
