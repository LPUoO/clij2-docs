Takes a pointlist and a touch matrix to determine the average angle of adjacent triangles in a surface mesh. For every point, the average angle of adjacent triangles is saved.

### Usage in ImageJ macro
```
Ext.CLIJx_averageAngleBetweenAdjacentTriangles(Image pointlist, Image touch_matrix, ByRef Image average_distancelist_destination);
```
