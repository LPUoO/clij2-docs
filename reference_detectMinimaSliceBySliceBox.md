Detects local minima in a given square neighborhood of an input image stack. The input image stack is 
processed slice by slice. Pixels in the resulting image are set to 1 if there is no other pixel in a 
given radius which has a lower intensity, and to 0 otherwise.

### Usage in ImageJ macro
```
Ext.CLIJ2_detectMinimaSliceBySliceBox(Image source, Image destination, Number radius);
```
