Trains a Weka model using functionality of Fijis Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin. 

It takes a 3D feature stack (e.g. first plane original image, second plane blurred, third plane edge image)and trains a Weka model. This model will be saved to disc.
The given groundTruth image is supposed to be a label map where pixels with value 1 represent class 1, pixels with value 2 represent class 2 and so on. Pixels with value 0 will be ignored for training.

### Usage in ImageJ macro
```
Ext.CLIJx_trainWekaModel(Image featureStack3D, Image groundTruth2D, String saveModelFilename);
```
