Applies an affine transform to a 3D image. Individual transforms must be separated by spaces.

Supported transforms:
* center: translate the coordinate origin to the center of the image
* -center: translate the coordinate origin back to the initial origin
* rotate=[angle]: rotate in X/Y plane (around Z-axis) by the given angle in degrees
* rotateX=[angle]: rotate in Y/Z plane (around X-axis) by the given angle in degrees
* rotateY=[angle]: rotate in X/Z plane (around Y-axis) by the given angle in degrees
* rotateZ=[angle]: rotate in X/Y plane (around Z-axis) by the given angle in degrees
* scale=[factor]: isotropic scaling according to given zoom factor
* scaleX=[factor]: scaling along X-axis according to given zoom factor
* scaleY=[factor]: scaling along Y-axis according to given zoom factor
* scaleZ=[factor]: scaling along Z-axis according to given zoom factor
* shearXY=[factor]: shearing along X-axis in XY plane according to given factor
* shearXZ=[factor]: shearing along X-axis in XZ plane according to given factor
* shearYX=[factor]: shearing along Y-axis in XY plane according to given factor
* shearYZ=[factor]: shearing along Y-axis in YZ plane according to given factor
* shearZX=[factor]: shearing along Z-axis in XZ plane according to given factor
* shearZY=[factor]: shearing along Z-axis in YZ plane according to given factor
* translateX=[distance]: translate along X-axis by distance given in pixels
* translateY=[distance]: translate along X-axis by distance given in pixels
* translateZ=[distance]: translate along X-axis by distance given in pixels

Example transform:
transform = "center scale=2 rotate=45 -center";

### Usage in ImageJ macro
